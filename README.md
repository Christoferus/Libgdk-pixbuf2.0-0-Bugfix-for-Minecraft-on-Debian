Oftentimes, when Debian users try to install the Minecraft.deb file from minecraft.net,
they encounter the error "Dependency is not satisfiable: libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 (>=2.22.0).
This is caused by a missing hyphen between "pixbuf" and "2." I repackaged the .deb file
with the proper dependency name, tested it on hardware, and it installs without any errors.
Apart from this, all credit goes to the maintainer Petr Mr√°zek at petr@mojang.com, and to
Mojang and Microsoft in terms of the Minecraft ecosystem. I hope this helps a lot of you,
particularly new and longtime Debian users.
